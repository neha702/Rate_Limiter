# C++ Rate Limiter

This project implements a pluggable **Rate Limiter** system in C++ using object-oriented design principles. The system supports multiple rate limiting strategies such as Token Bucket or Fixed Window, and is extensible via a strategy pattern.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Object-oriented design with clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Strategy pattern for easy extension of rate limiting algorithms
- ✅ `RateLimiterManager` handles routing to appropriate limiter
- ✅ Factory pattern to create instances of rate limiters
- ✅ Testable via `main.cpp` entry point
